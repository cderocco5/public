## AI Azure Role Risk Assessment Overview

This project is an AI-powered tool that analyzes Azure roles based on activity logs and identifies roles with potentially excessive permissions.

- Fetch Azure Activity Logs
- Analyze Azure Role Definitions
- Detect unused permissions
- Generate risk scores using AI (Isolation Forest)
- LLM-generated explanations and recommendations

## AI Network Defender Overview
**AI Network Defender** is an AI-powered cybersecurity tool that analyzes firewall logs using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

It acts like a virtual SOC analyst by:
- Ingesting Palo Alto firewall logs  
- Retrieving similar historical events  
- Enriching analysis with MITRE ATT&CK framework and a RAG of specific flow logs 
- Generating AI-driven threat assessments  by analyzing Palo Alto firewall logs  
- RAG-based contextual reasoning  
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping for threats  
- Threat classification (low / medium / high)  
- Human-readable explanations and response recommendations

## AI Wiz Auto-remediation Engine

This project is an LLM AI cloud remediation engine that processes hypothetical Wiz CNAPP findings and automatically generates terraform templates and AWS CLI for fixes.

Combines:

- Machine Learning for classification
- OpenAI LLM to create remediations
- Rule-based fallbacks ( can use RAGs when more developed )
